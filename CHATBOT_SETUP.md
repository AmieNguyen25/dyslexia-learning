# AI Chatbot Setup Instructions

## Overview
The AI chatbot feature uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model to provide intelligent, dyslexia-friendly math learning assistance.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get an OpenAI API Key
1. Visit [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Create an account or sign in
3. Navigate to API Keys section
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the key (you won't be able to see it again)

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
2. Open `.env.local` and replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual API key:
   ```
   VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here
   ```

### 3. Security Considerations

**Important**: This implementation exposes the API key in the frontend, which is only suitable for development and prototyping.

For production, you should:
- Create a backend API endpoint that handles OpenAI requests
- Store the API key securely on the server side
- Implement proper authentication and rate limiting
- Use environment variables on the server (not client-side)

### 4. Fallback Mode
If no API key is configured, the chatbot will automatically use pre-written fallback responses that still provide helpful learning guidance.

## Chatbot Features

### AI Assistant Capabilities
- **Math Help**: Explains algebra, geometry, fractions, and other math concepts
- **Step-by-Step Guidance**: Breaks down complex problems into manageable steps
- **Dyslexia-Friendly**: Uses clear, simple language and short sentences
- **Encouraging**: Provides positive reinforcement and motivation
- **Adaptive**: Remembers conversation context for better assistance

### User Interface
- **Floating Action Button**: Always accessible chat button in bottom-right
- **Full-Screen Mobile**: Responsive design that works on all devices
- **Voice Integration**: Can read AI responses aloud using text-to-speech
- **Message History**: Maintains conversation context during the session
- **Typing Indicators**: Shows when AI is generating a response

## Usage
1. Click the chat button (ðŸ’¬) in the bottom-right corner
2. Type your math question or request for help
3. Press Enter or click Send
4. The AI will provide personalized, learning-focused assistance
5. Use the speaker button to hear responses read aloud

## Cost Considerations
- OpenAI charges per token used
- Each conversation costs approximately $0.001-0.01 depending on length
- Consider implementing usage limits for production deployment
- Monitor usage through OpenAI dashboard

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **"I need an API key to work properly"**: Set up your API key in `.env.local`
2. **"Rate limit exceeded"**: You're making too many requests, wait and try again
3. **"Quota exceeded"**: You've reached your OpenAI usage limit, check your account
4. **Connection errors**: Check internet connection and API key validity

### Development Mode
When developing without an API key, the chatbot provides helpful pre-written responses for common math topics and learning scenarios.
